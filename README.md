## Hey. <img align="right" src="https://wallpapers-clan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cool-anime-pfp-2-23.jpg" width="200" />
I'm **Chillmaster**, but more commonly referred/known as "Chill". I'm a developer, native to the Philippines, but emigrated the the US at an early age.

I've been developing over the years, aquiring an adequete skill set. I'm proficent at Python, while also being quite knowledgeable at Java, Luau and C#. I've also aquired knowledge in CSS and HTML. I'm planning to learn JavaScript, PHP, SQL, TypeScript, Rust, and eventually C++ to end it all.
  
Thanks for viewing my profile. I'll have open source respositories to showcase my works (Soon, NOT NOW)
